🌟 Day 9: Solving LeetCode Challenges 🚀

Hey everyone! 👋 I’m back with another update on my 50 Days LeetCode Milestone Challenge. Day 9 was all about refining my skills in array manipulation and mathematical reasoning. Here’s a look at what I tackled today:

Contents:
1. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array (Q26)
    - Approach: Employed the two-pointer technique to remove duplicates efficiently in-place.
    - Time Complexity: O(n) ⏳

2. Count of Matches in Tournament (Q1688)
    - Approach: Used a mathematical approach to determine the total number of matches needed to find the champion in a knockout tournament.
    - Time Complexity: O(1) ⏳

Why This Matters:
Both problems highlight the importance of understanding core principles like array manipulation and mathematical reasoning, which are crucial for problem-solving in competitive programming and real-world applications.

Repository Structure:
- `remove_duplicates_sorted_array.cpp`: Implementation of the two-pointer technique to remove duplicates from a sorted array.
- `count_of_matches_tournament.cpp`: Code that calculates the total number of matches in a knockout tournament.
- `README.md`: This file provides a summary and explanation of the code files.

How to Use:
- Check out the code files to see how these problems were solved.
- Use these examples to enhance your understanding and tackle similar challenges in your own coding journey.

Feel free to star ⭐️ and fork 🍴 the repository to keep these solutions handy. I’m open to contributions and discussions!

Let’s keep pushing forward together! 💪

Happy coding! 💻✨
